Cut files for Silhouette Portrait (and other cutters).

They're designed to work with <a href="https://github.com/lexelby/inkscape-silhouette">inkscape-silhouette</a>, but in theory they ought to work with Silhouette Studio.  The paid version would be necessary because the free one can't load SVG files.

I use two different colors as follows:

* *blue*: cut 
* *red*: score

For cut lines, set pressure/speed/blade depth appropriately for your material.  For score lines, set pressure to 1 for plain paper, and 2-3 for cardstock and heavier.  Regardless of what depth you have your blade set to, this seems to create a nice score line on paper that makes it easy to fold.
