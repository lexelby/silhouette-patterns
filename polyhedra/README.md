These patterns produce regular polygons with sides of equal lengths.  Each side has a tab and slot, allowing you to hook it up to any other shape.  By hooking up a bunch of shapes, you can make nifty 3d objects!

For example, by combining 12 pentagons, you'd get an dodecahedron.  Do this by joining two pentagons, A, and B, along one side, then joining a third pentagon C, to an adjacent side on B, and finally connecting the neighboring sides of A and C.  Continue the pattern and you'll ultimately end up with an dodecahedron.

Another fun one is the truncated icosahedron.  This is a "bucky ball", which is also the pattern on a soccer ball.  It's made of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons.  Each pentagon is surrounded by 5 hexagons.

For these, I use very thick cardstock.  110lb or heavier is ideal.  When cutting, I find that it works best to cut twice at a blade depth of 8 and a pressure of 27.
