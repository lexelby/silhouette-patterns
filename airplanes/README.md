Paper airplane patterns for Silhouette Portrait (and other cutters).

The goal is to produce a piece of paper with printed and scored fold lines.  To fold the paper airplane, fold each line in turn.  The score lines should make folding along the line feel natural.  Always fold in the direction that covers up the number.

My printer can do double-sided printing.  If I use plain paper and print the PDFs, the lines on the front and back seem to line up perfectly.  I'm not sure all printers would be this accurate.

To achieve this, I have to set the "page scaling" to "crop (preserve dimensions)" so that it doesn't try to scale down the PDF to fit the printable area.  I set double-sided printing to "long edge".

The registration marks included are for <a href="https://github.com/inkscape-silhoeutte">inskcape-silhouette</a>.  I have no idea whether they'd work for Silhouette Studio.  It may be necessary to ignore the regmarks in the SVG and use Silhoeutte Studio's builtin regmarks.  That may also require scaling the entire design down a bit to fit in the space allowed by silhouette studio.
